  <h2>Something I Learned</h2>
  <p> I have learned many different things in this class, but one main thing that really stuck to me the impact of bugs in your coding. It was interesting to me how one small mistake can have the impact of something not working properly.
  <h2>Advice For ECS Students</h2>
  <p> The advice I would give future ECS students is to be patient and not get frustrated. I'm saying this because coding is something that requires you to pay attention to small details.
