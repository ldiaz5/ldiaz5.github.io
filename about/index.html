    <body>
       My full name is Larissa Diaz, no middle name. <br>
       I was born on February 14, 2004 in Evanston, Illinois. <br>
       The name Larissa was given to me after a telenovela or tv show my mother once watched. <br>
       It had caught her attention and my father also liked it.

    <body>
        What I'd want my future career to be is a dermatologist. <br>
        It is one of my goals along with being able to provide for myself comfortably. <br>
        My desired location of residence is nothing in particular. <br>
        I believe that is something that I can figure out along the way.
